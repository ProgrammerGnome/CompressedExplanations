# 📺 Compressed Explanations

### Computer Science, Mathematics. Mind. No Speech.

A collection of **visual, silent explanations** built using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/).  
The goal of this project is to **make complex concepts immediately intuitive**, showing the essence of ideas through motion, structure, and visual reasoning — **without narration**.  
Each animation focuses on revealing a core idea or concept, breaking it down into structured steps and visualized meaning.

## 🎯 Objective
